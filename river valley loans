Payday lenders often provide no-credit-check loans that don’t check your credit score before lending money. Often considered predatory, payday loans are intended to help consumers during an emergency or when they don’t have another source of credit.
The amount of a payday loan is smaller than a personal loan, often limited to about $500 and the interest rates are often much higher than with traditional loans. Payday loans are often short-term, high-cost loans with interest rates that can keep you stuck in the debt cycle for years. When applying for these loans, your credit score isn’t checked because your paycheck is used as security against the amount borrowed.
