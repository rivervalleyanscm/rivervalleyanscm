A personal loan is money provided by a lender that is repaid in monthly installments over a fixed period at a fixed interest rate. These loans are available from online lenders, private lenders and credit unions.

The proceeds from a personal loan are provided in a lump sum and can be used to fund various needs. The repayment terms also cover a wide range of borrower needs, ranging from 24 months to 60 months, with some offering terms as high as 72 months.
